# s6m

Repository for random Uni stuff. Not meant for bigger projects like GVI.

The master branch is used for files relevant for everybody. You can get these files by cherry-picking or merging the master into your own branch.

If you dont have a branch already its recommended to create your own with 

  git checkout -b new_branch old_branch

to get all the content from master e.g. .gitignore
